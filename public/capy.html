            <h1>The Fascinating World of Capybaras</h1>
            <img class="capy-img" src="/img/capibara.png" alt="Capibara">
            <p>Capybaras, often referred to as the world's largest rodents, captivate with their unique charm and
                intriguing behaviors. Native to South America, these semi-aquatic mammals are found in a variety of
                habitats, from dense forests to savannas and wetlands. Renowned for their social nature, capybaras are
                often spotted lounging near water bodies, forming tight-knit groups called herds.</p>

            <h2>Social Creatures of the Wild</h2>

            <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of capybaras is their highly social behavior. Living in groups of up
                to 100 individuals, they establish strong bonds through grooming, vocalizations, and communal activities
                like mud baths. This social structure not only provides protection against predators but also fosters a
                sense of community vital for their survival in the wild.</p>

            <h2>Unique Adaptations for Survival</h2>

            <p>Capybaras boast several adaptations that aid their survival in their diverse habitats. Their webbed feet
                make them adept swimmers, enabling them to escape threats and forage for aquatic plants. Furthermore,
                their eyes, ears, and nostrils are strategically positioned on the top of their heads, allowing them to
                remain submerged in water while staying vigilant for predators.</p>

            <h2>Conservation Concerns and Cultural Significance</h2>

            <p>Despite their widespread presence in South America, capybaras face threats from habitat loss, hunting,
                and competition with livestock. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and
                mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Additionally, capybaras hold cultural significance in some South
                American communities, featuring in folklore and traditional practices, further highlighting the
                importance of their conservation. Understanding and safeguarding these remarkable creatures is essential
                for maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats and preserving their cultural heritage for
                future generations.</p>
